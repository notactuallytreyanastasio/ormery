# ORMery

This file is used for library configuration.

The `name` export defines the library name:

    export let name = "ormery";

Dependencies on other Temper modules:

    export let dependencies = ["../secure-composition"];

By default, the current directory is imported as a module. It can import
other module directories. See Temper documentation for additional config
options.
